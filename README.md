This project involves modifying a Bruder Claas Jaguar model to fill shot glasses using a pump and a servo.
The glasses are distributed around the shredder and are detected by a switch. The arm of the shredder then swings out and fills the selected glass with the desired liquor using the pump. This project requires technical knowledge in modification and electronics. A detailed guide on how to execute this project is not included in this description.
